# Weblog
This is a Flask web application that serves as a simple blogging platform. It allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. The application uses Flask-WTF for form handling, Flask-CKEditor for a rich text editor to create blog posts, Flask-Bootstrap for styling, and Flask-SQLAlchemy to store blog posts in an SQLite database.
